# Grade-12
# Everything outside of the Engineering Folder was done in my Computer Science class.  I coded in Java for that course.  Every project was completed independently.
# The Engineering Folder has a handful of projects I worked on in the Computer Engineering course.  In that course I coded in Python, Java, and HTML.  All projects in the Engineering folder were completed in collaboration with Zainab Fathi, my assigned partner.
